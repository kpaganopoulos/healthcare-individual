Individual Assignment: Exploring health issues emerging from a survey dataset

Point of view

Using the AddHealth data, please choose one or two health related variable(s) of interest, and imagine you are producing a short report on this issue that can be used by policy makers to better understand the problem(s) with this/ese health outcome(s) of interest, or to support the funding of a deeper or more complex analysis.

You can use technical terms and pursue an analysis whose process is similar to the one we did with the HALS data.

Your report should first discuss the relevance of your topic, and what the literature tells us about it.

For your analysis, you will have to select other relevant variables (“the confounders”), prepare your data and present your sample, and illustrate how your main health related variable(s) is/are associated with the other variables that you have selected. You could implement a regression method, or another relevant technic to better understand what the main determinants of your health outcome(s) are. You can apply some specification tests or do a sensitivity analysis to complement your main analysis if you think it would add to your analysis.

You will then interpret your results and discuss them in a broader context.

The marking grid below will help you understand the expected structure of your report and the relative relevance of the different parts.


Format of the Report

The written report should be of a maximum of 5 pages excluding appendices and references (5-10 pages expected length of extra material including graphs, tables, and bibliography).

At least one table or graph should be part of your main report; the rest can be included in the appendices.

The fonts are Book Antiqua or Times New Roman. Font size of the main text must be 12. A larger font (14) can be used for headings. Line spacing must be 1.5. Please use Harvard referencing.

Content and Marking (out of 20 points)

You will be marked on the quality of the data presentation and your interpretation of the data and results.

Introduction (3/20)
• Some context (background, motivation, objectives)
• Identify about 3 papers from the literature that are the closest to your project
and briefly describe them (what are their main conclusions?).

Descriptive statistics (5/20)
• About 10-15 variables - about 2 health measures + individual characteristics,
socio-economic information
• Explain your selection, how the variables are measured, how they change
over time
• Choose appropriate graphs (static vs temporal, etc).

Regressions (6/20): describe how health measures are associated with your
other variables
• Some simple regressions or machine learning methods using the appropriate
models depending on the outcomes
• Exploit the data: panel data methods, predictions, different levels of analysis
(individual level, family level, different socio-economic groups).

Discuss your limitations (3/20), Correct use of weights (1/20), Appendix (2/20)
• Quality of the appendix, relevance of the information provided, referencing,
code.

Make sure:
• To clearly state your objectives
• To correctly label your graphs, titles, data and axis
• To have tables that contain enough information to interpret the results
• To cite sources and report your references.
